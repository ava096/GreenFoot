# GreenFoot
This project is an application that allows users to contribute to a database of the tree population in the Belfast area, as well as view the database and use for their own purposes.

The .env files are not included with the project. To install the dependencies necessary for the back-end, make sure you are at the root folder of the directory and run npm install
in the terminal. To install the necessary files in the front-end, make sure you are in the correct folder by entering cd frontend in the terminal, and then again npm install to
install all necessary dependencies in the front-end.
